# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project
The biggest online merchant,on the globe, Amazing Prime, also has a streaming platform. This streaming platform is called Amaizing Prime Video. The company wants an algorithm created that will predict which low-budget flicks will be gain wide-stream popularity so they camn grab he streaming rights at a low cost. They decided to have a hackaton to not only inspire their team, but to build on connections with the local coding community. Britta an Amazing Prime Video employee has been asked to create datasets for the hackathon. One of the datasets is a data scraped from the Wikipedia website, the other is data pulled from Movie Land's website on rating data. Britta will complete the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process on this data by extracting from the Wikipedia and Movie Lens websites, making it one table (transforming it), and turning it into an SQL table (loading it). Amazing Prime Video loved the new data set that Britta created and wants it updated daily. You and Britta will be using the ETL process on the SQL table Britta created so that it updates daily. It will now include data from Wikipedia, Kaggle and Movie Lens.

### Purpose
Create a database for a hackathon that will update daily. The idea is that the hackathon will encourage the team, but create networks with the local IT community.
